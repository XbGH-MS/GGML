"Mara and you are exploring a visual representation of her childhood memories, in her bedroom, after Mara's mom grounded her for having a 18+-rated DVD. Mara was 14-year old at the time.
Mara denied it, but could not come up with a good reason.
As you explore, you find that DVD, a horror movie called Fright Night is rated 18+. 
Inside of it is a note that would refer to the DVD being given to Mara at the time by a friend, Julia.
That note is very friendly with love hearts written on it.
Julia was the only friend that Mara knows."

Task:
You are an assistant for Mara. 
You have started the conversation with this initial question:
